Hello! I'm a PhD graduate from the Department of Linguistics at University of California, Davis, advised by [Kenji Sagae](http://www.sagae.org). 

My research interests lie in crosslinguistic variation. My work tries to better understand what people say, why they would say that and when they would say that. I address these questions from the angle of language typology, documentation of endangered languages, and language development, with a non-western mind. My favourite methodology is a data-driven approach coupled with [The #BenderRule](https://thegradient.pub/the-benderrule-on-naming-the-languages-we-study-and-why-it-matters/) and methods of number counting at varying degrees of complication. 

My non-research interests are music, food, and simple methods, and in that order too.


Brief Bio
======

Fall 2020 -
------

Starting late Fall 2020, I will be working as a postdoctoral fellow with [Emily Tucker Prud'hommeaux](http://cs.bc.edu/~prudhome/publications.html) in the Department of Computer Science at Boston College, where I'll be splitting time between endangered language documentation and pragmatic analysis of language development in children with autism spectrum disorder. The former will be focusing on developing and applying natural language generation technologies to the Iroquoian language family, most of which have very few or no living native/fluent speakers whose communities are currently engaged in efforts to reclaim their heritage languages.

2016 - Summer 2020
------

During this time, I got a PhD. My dissertation project focuses on crosslinguistic modeling of word order preferences, adopting a data-driven approach to investigate what abstract constraints as well as idiosyncrasies govern language users' structural choices from both synchronic and diachronic perspectives. Additionally, this project also tries to adapt theoretical framework of dependency syntax to develop a dependency treebank for Hupa, an endangered Dene language of northwestern California traditionally spoken in Hoopa Valley on the lower Trinity River in present-day Humboldt County, as a way to formalize and model the syntax of indigenous languages.

Summer 2019 
------

During this time, I interned as a software developer at the Cognitive Computing Lab at [Baidu](http://research.baidu.com/Index). I worked on designing knowledge represetations for English and Mandarin Chinese to facilitate open information extraction.
