Hello! I'm a PhD graduate from the Department of Linguistics at University of California, Davis, advised by [Kenji Sagae](http://www.sagae.org). My research interests lie in crosslinguistic variation. My work tries to better understand what people say, why they would say that and when they would say that. I address these questions from the angle of language typology, documentation of endangered languages, and language development, using a data-driven approach and methods of number counting at varying degree of complication. 

My non-research interests are music, food, and simple methods, and in that order too.

Bio
======

Fall 2020 -
------

Starting late Fall 2020, I will be working as a postdoctoral fellow with [Emily Tucker Prud'hommeaux](http://cs.bc.edu/~prudhome/publications.html) in the Department of Computer Science at Boston College. I will be focusing on developing and applying natural language generation technologies to the Iroquoian language family, most of which have very few or no living native/fluent speakers whose communities are currently engaged in efforts to reclaim their heritage languages.

2016 - Summer 2020

During this time, I got a PhD. My dissertation project focuses on crosslinguistic modeling of word order preferences, adopting a data-driven approach to explain empirically why regular and idiosyncratic syntactic features across languages are the way they are. This project explores three directions in particular. First, I investigate and quantify the roles of various abstract constraints in ordering preferences. Secondly, I ask why language users have idiosyncratic ordering preferences and how regularization of this idiosyncrasy arises diachronically, borrowing Bayesianiterated learning models from language evolution and statistical learning. Thirdly, I adapted theoretical framework of dependency syntax to develop a dependency treebank for Hupa, an endangered Dene language of northwestern California traditionally spoken in Hoopa Valley on the lower Trinity River in present-day Humboldt County, as a way to formalize and model the syntax of indigenous languages
