Hello! I'm an Assistant Professor of Computational Language Science in the [Department of Linguistics](https://lin.ufl.edu/) at [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu/), where I lead the [Computational Linguistics Lab](https://ufcompling.github.io). 

Before joining UF, I was a [2021-2023 Computing Innovation Fellow](https://cccblog.org/2021/07/22/announcing-the-2021-computing-innovation-fellows/) supported by the National Science Foundation / Computing Research Association, and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Computer Science at Boston College. I received my Ph.D. in Linguistics from University of California, Davis in 2020; in Summer 2019, I interned as a software developer at the Cognitive Computing Lab at [Baidu](http://research.baidu.com/Index). Before that, I received a B.A. in Translation from [Nankai University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nankai_University).

My research program studies ***variation/generalization*** in languages, machines and their intersections. I address related questions from aspects of language typology, language learning and multilingual NLP evaluation, along with a non-western mind. The general methodology that I use is a data-driven approach coupled with [The #BenderRule](https://thegradient.pub/the-benderrule-on-naming-the-languages-we-study-and-why-it-matters/) and methods of number counting at varying degrees of carbon dioxide consumption. 

Besides academic responsibilities, I proudly serve on the planning committee for [Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival](https://aicls.org), and their biennial institute [Breath of Life](https://aicls.org/breath-of-life-institute/). 

My real-life interests are music, food, and simple methods, and in that order too.
