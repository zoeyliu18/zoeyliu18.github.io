Hello! I'm an Assistant Professor of Computational Language Science in the [Department of Linguistics](https://lin.ufl.edu/) at [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu/), where I lead the [Computational Linguistics Lab](https://ufcompling.github.io). 

Before joining UF, I was a 2021-2023 [Computing Innovation Fellow](https://cccblog.org/2021/07/22/announcing-the-2021-computing-innovation-fellows/) supported by the National Science Foundation / Computing Research Association, and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Computer Science at Boston College.

My research program studies ***variation*** in languages, machines and their intersections. I address related questions from aspects of language typology, language learning and multilingual NLP, along with a non-western mind. The general methodology that I use is a data-driven approach coupled with [The #BenderRule](https://thegradient.pub/the-benderrule-on-naming-the-languages-we-study-and-why-it-matters/) and methods of number counting at varying degrees of carbon dioxide consumption. 

Besides academic responsibilities, I proudly serve on the planning committee for [Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival](https://aicls.org), and their biennial institute [Breath of Life](https://aicls.org/breath-of-life-institute/). 

My real-life interests are music, food, and simple methods, and in that order too.


Something extra
------

2020 - 2022
------

During my postdoc, I worked on developing model evaluation methods and language technology for low-resource multilingual NLP, mentored by [Emily Tucker Prud'hommeaux](http://cs.bc.edu/~prudhome/publications.html).

2016 - 2020
------

I did my PhD in Linguistics at University of California, Davis, advised by [Kenji Sagae](http://compling.ucdavis.edu/sagae/index.html). My [dissertation project](http://zoeyliu18.github.io/files/Zoey_Dissertation.pdf) focused on crosslinguistic modeling of word order preferences. Additionally, this project also tried to adapt theoretical framework of dependency syntax to develop a treebank for Hupa, an endangered Dene language of northwestern California traditionally spoken in Hoopa Valley on the lower Trinity River in present-day Humboldt County, as a way to formalize and model the syntax of indigenous languages. 

Besides school I interned as a software developer at the Cognitive Computing Lab at [Baidu](http://research.baidu.com/Index) in Summer 2019. I worked on designing graph represetations for open-domain information extraction in English and Mandarin.

2014 - 2016
------

Before the PhD, I thought to try for an MA in Linguistics first at UC Davis, advised by [Raul Aranovich](https://linguistics.ucdavis.edu/people/raranovi). My thesis looked at authorship attribution for short text documents.
